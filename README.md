# Björk
## 'Post' vs. 'Debut'
### Introduction
In this portfolio I'm going to compare the most (Post) and least (Debut) popular album of Björk. To get a first impression, I'm going to
compare three characteristics of this album. These being danceability (I think this contributes a lot to popularity), speechiness (because
of Björks very special voice) and valence (extreme valence values also have a huge impact on album popularity I think).

### Characteristics
#### Post
Post has an album popularity of 62. 
*danceability*
Mean = 0.444, SD=0.142
*speechiness*
Mean = 0.0413, SD = 0.00908 
*valence*
Mean = 0.242, SD = 0.155

#### Debut
Debut has an album popularity of 11.
*danceability*
Mean = 0.606, SD = 0.120 
*speechiness*
Mean = 0.0437, SD = 0.0189 
*valence*
Mean = 0.427, SD = 0.256

### Findings
The **danceability** of Debut is higher than that of Post. This was against my expecations.
The **speechiness** of both albums is not very high. These values are not really useable, because spotify says that values below 0.33
speechiness describe non-vocal music, which Björks music clearly isn't. So I think I might not use the speechiness values in further
comparisons.
**Valence** values of Post are lower than that of Debut. But the standard deviation of Debut's valence is rather high. This may indicate
outliers. This is correct, the valence values of Debut range from 0.127 to 0.815... This may in turn indicate that people like more
consistent albums, which are either (very) happy or (very) sad.
